# Pixel shuffle and unshuffle 3D for Torch
These are 3D implementation of https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.PixelUnshuffle.html and https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.PixelShuffle.html. The speed is not optimized, but it works. Check `Real-Time Single Image and Video Super-Resolution Using an Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network` by Shi et. al (2016) for more details.
